1. Make sure to setup Spring Boot Application & follow TDD Approach for the Assignment


       First identified the test cases for data boundaries:
       i)   when lowest key is entered - lower bound 
       ii)  when highest key is entered - upper bound
       iii) when  exact in min max range is entered - matching
       iv)  when key is in min max range - key in range
      
2. Follow Standard Coding Practices( Naming Conventions, Class/Method/In-line Comments etc..)

        Strictly followed the coding conventions

3. Shared the source code git link 

        Yes
        
4. Brief the approach you took to solve the problem and how you achieved the end result

    First I tried to solve the problem with brute force method, tried to apply recursion and get
    the optimum result, but was not successful
    
    This problem was exhibiting the properties of Dynamic programming problem, then I started searching for 
    then I cam across 1-Knapsack algorithm which gives an optimum way of finding maximum profit or satisfaction
    from a combination of options
    
    Then implemented the 1-Knapsack algorithm to solve the same
    
5. Provide Maximum Satisfaction Value you achieved in your response.
    
     For given T = 1000 the maximum satisfaction achieved is = 748545                     

Assumptions:
1. Fraction time and fraction satisfaction is not allowed
2. As the Service object is available it can be always be injected into the controller, to call its methods
